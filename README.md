# APIs
Objective of this exercise is to learn APIs. 
You are expected to: 

Let’s study the (Weather.gov API)[https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api]
Let’s study (OpenWeatherMAP API)[https://openweathermap.org/api]
For all (USA Airports)[https://github.com/datasets/airport-codes], Develop an API and module where we can get current conditions for the airport asked by the API and we can get current weather graphs for specific period
I am expecting to use CB and CI in the exercise
I am also expecting you to developing examples using your API
