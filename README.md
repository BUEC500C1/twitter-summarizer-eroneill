## User Story 

I am an avaition passenger and I would like to input my two airport codes of my flight (ex. BOS, MCO) to see the forecast for the next 24 hours at my origin and destination airports. 

# APIs
Objective of this exercise is to learn APIs. 
You are expected to: 

Let’s study the [Weather.gov API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api)

Let’s study [OpenWeatherMAP API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

For all [USA Airports](https://github.com/datasets/airport-codes), Develop an API and module where we can get current conditions for the airport asked by the API and we can get current weather graphs for specific period

I am expecting to use CB and CI in the exercise

I am also expecting you to developing examples using your API

Project is Due 2/5/2020
